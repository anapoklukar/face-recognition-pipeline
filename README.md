This project was developed for the **Image-Based Biometry** course at the University of Ljubljana. It implements a complete face recognition pipeline, including face detection, feature extraction, and recognition evaluation. The methods are evaluated using metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) and Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) curves.  

The repository includes a Jupyter notebook with the full implementation and a detailed PDF report. Key components include:  
- **Face Detection:** Optimized Viola-Jones algorithm.  
- **Feature Extraction:** LBP, HOG, and Dense SIFT.  
- **Recognition Evaluation:** Performance analysis for both individual methods and the full pipeline.
